## Perfect Layout

given an array of images in the form

```
{
  src: "path/to/image.jpg",
  ratio: 1.5
}
```

returns an array of images in the form
```
{
  src: "path/to/image.jpg",
  width: WIDTH,
  height: HEIGHT
}
```

whre WIDTH and HEIGHT are the dimensions that image must have to fit the layout.
